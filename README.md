THE PROBLEM 

YouTube is a great platform for learning anything, you can find videos on almost any topic. Some YouTube playlists are better than paid courses, but the problem is when you start learning from YouTube you end up watching tons of unrelated videos. Videos on youtube are unstructured and also you cannot track your progress on Youtube. To solve this problem I am introducing you to E-class


INTRODUCTION

E-class is a website where you will find the best courses on YouTube, in a structured format, you can also track your progress. The instructor can turn their YouTube Playlist into a structured course in just a few minutes. You can become an instructor and add courses to the site once you are verified(but currently I'm allowing anyone to become an instructor so that people can test the application).
